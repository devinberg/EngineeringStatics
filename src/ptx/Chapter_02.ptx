<title>3D Dot Products</title>


<p>This section will build on the basics of dot products started in <xref provisional="2D Dot Products"/> earlier in this chapter. Recall that dot products are used to find the amount of one vector parallel to another and are also useful to find the angle between two vectors. </p>
<p>Previously, we found that the dot product of the parallel unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\ihat</m> was 1, while the dot product of the perpendicular unit vectors <m>\ihat</m> and <m>\jhat</m> was 0. We can expand this general relationship where the dot products of any two parallel unit vectors is 1 and the dot product of any two perpendicular unit vectors is zero to demonstrate that</p>
<p><md><mrow>\ihat \cdot \ihat \amp= 1 \amp \jhat \cdot \ihat \amp= 0 \amp \khat \cdot \ihat \amp= 0</mrow><mrow>\ihat \cdot \jhat \amp= 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \jhat \amp= 1 \amp \khat \cdot \jhat \amp= 0</mrow><mrow>\ihat \cdot \khat \amp= 0 \amp \jhat \cdot \khat \amp= 0 \amp \khat \cdot \khat \amp= 1</mrow></md></p>
<p>For 3D vectors we can also write that a dot product is equal to the sum-product of the like components:</p>
<p><me>\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} =A_x B_x +A_y B_y + A_z B_z=\left ( A \right )\left ( B \right )\cos \theta</me></p>
