<p>This is a single equation with a single unknown, although is is not particularly easy to solve with algebra.  On approach is described <a class="external" href="https://socratic.org/questions/59e5f259b72cff6c4402a6a5" target="_blank">here</a>. An alternate approach is to use technology to graph the function \(y(x) = 2 + 2 \sin x - 3 \cos x\text{.}\)  The roots of this equation correspond to values of \(\alpha\) which satisfy the equilibrium condition above.  The root occurring closest to \(x=0\) will be the answer corresponding to our problem, in this case \(\alpha = 22.62°\) which you can verify by plugging it back into the equilibrium equation.  Note that -90° also satisfies this equation, but it is not the solution we are looking for.</p>
