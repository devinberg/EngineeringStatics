<p>If you consider the forces acting on the top of a pole beside a curving section of road you'll observe that the tensions of the cables produce a net force towards the road.  This force is typically opposed by a “guy wire” pulling in the opposite direction which prevents the pole from moving (tipping over) due to unbalanced forces.  The power company tries to keep poles beside road segments with convex curvature. If they didn't switch sides, the guy wire for poles at concave curves would extend into the road... which is a poor design.</p>
