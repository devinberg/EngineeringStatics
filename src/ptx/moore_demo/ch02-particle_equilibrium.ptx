    <title>Static Equilibrium</title>
    <p>Objects in static equilibrium are objects that are not accelerating (either linear
      acceleration or angular acceleration). These objects may be stationary, such as a building or
      a bridge, or they may have a constant velocity, such as a car or truck moving at a constant
      speed on a strait patch of road.</p>

    <p>Newton's second law states that the force exerted on an objects is equal to the mass of the
      object times the acceleration it experiences. Therefore, if we know that the acceleration of
      an object is equal to zero, then we can assume that the sum of all forces acting on the object
      are is zero. Individual forces acting on the object, represented by force vectors, may not
      have zero magnitude but the sum of all the force vectors will always be equal to zero for
      objects in equilibrium. Engineering statics is the study of objects in static equilibrium, and
      the simple assumption of all forces adding up to zero is the basis for the subject area of
      engineering statics.</p>

    <p>Equilibrium follows a similar pattern for angular accelerations. The rotational equivalent of
      Newton's second states that the moment exerted on an object is equal to the moment of inertia
      of that object times the angular acceleration of the object. If we know the angular
      acceleration of an object is equal to zero, then we know the sum of all moments acting on the
      object is equal to zero.</p>

    <title>Point Forces</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>A point force is any force where the <em> point of application </em> is considered to be a
          <em> single point </em> . In reality, most forces are technically surface forces, where
        the force is applied over an area, but when the area is small enough (in comparison to the
        bodies being analyzed) it can often be approximated as a point force. Because point forces
        can be represented as a single vector (rather than a field of vectors for distributed
        forces), they are much easier to work with in engineering analysis. For this reason, point
        forces are used in place of distributed forces in engineering analysis whenever possible.
        Below are some examples of where it is appropriate to use point forces.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In addition to the magnitude, direction, and point of application of the point force,
        another important term to understand is the <em> line of action </em> of the force. The line
        of action of a force is the line along which the force acts. Given the direction and point
        of application, one can find the line of action, but this term will be important in
        discussing concurrent forces and in the principle of transmissibility.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Force Vector Representation</title>
      <p>When vectors are drawn in to free body diagrams, the magnitude and direction are usually
        given in one of two formats:<ul>
          <li>Overall magnitude and angle(s) to indicate direction (often called <em> magnitude and
              direction form </em> ).</li>
          <li>Magnitudes in each of the coordinate directions (often called <em> component form
            </em> ).</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>In either format we will need two values to fully define a force vector in a 2D system
        (either a magnitude and a single angle or a magnitude in each of the two coordinate axes),
        and three values to fully define a force vector in a 3D system (either a magnitude and two
        angles or a magnitude in each of the three coordinate axes). Below are some examples of
        force vectors in both representations.</p>
      <figure>

      <title>Changing Force Vector Forms:</title>
      <p>Because the two different forms of the vector are equivalent, we can switch between
        representations without changing the problem. Often in engineering problems, it will
        initially be easier to write the force in magnitude and angle form but later analysis will
        be easier if forces are written in component form. To switch from magnitude and direction
        form to component form you will use right triangles and trigonometry to determine the
        component of the overall magnitude in each direction. This is a simple vector decomposition,
        and more information on this process can be seen on the vector decomposition page. To switch
        back from component form into magnitude and direction form you simply use the reverse of
        this initial process.</p>

  <section xml:id="principle_of_transmissibility">
    <title>Principle of Transmissibility</title>
    <p>The principle of transmissibility states that the point of application of a force can be
      moved anywhere along its line of action without changing the <em> external reaction forces
      </em> on a <em> rigid body </em> . Any force that has the same magnitude and direction, and
      which has a point of application somewhere along the same line of action will cause the same
      acceleration and will result in the same moment. Therefore, the points of application of
      forces may be moved along the line of action to simplify the analysis of rigid bodies.</p>
    <figure>
      <title>Principle of Transmissibility</title>
      <caption>Because of the principle of transmissibility, each of the above pairs is
        equivalent.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/transmissibility.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>When analyzing the internal forces (stress) in a rigid body, the exact point of application
      does matter. This difference in stresses may also result in changes in geometry which will may
      in turn affect reaction forces. For this reason, the principle of transmissibility should only
      be used when examining external forces on bodies that are assumed to be rigid.</p>
    <figure>
      <title>Internal Forces and the Principle of Transmissibility</title>
      <caption>The exact point of application of a force will impact how internal forces (stresses)
        are distributed, so the principle of transmissibility cannot be applied when examining
        internal forces.</caption>

  <section xml:id="concurrent_forces">
    <title>Concurrent Forces</title>
    <p>A set of point forces is considered concurrent if all the <em> lines of action of those
        forces all come together at a single point </em> .</p>
    <figure>
      <title>Concurrent Forces</title>
      <caption>Because the lines of action for the gravitational force and the two tension forces
        line up at a single point, these forces are considered concurrent.</caption>

    </figure>
    <figure>
      <title>Non-Concurrent Forces</title>
      <caption>Because the lines of action of the gravitational force and the two normal forces do
        not intersect at a single point, these forces are not considered concurrent.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/nonconcurrent.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Because the forces all act through a single point, there are no moments about this point.
      Because no moments exist, we can treat this body as a <em> particle </em> . In fact, because
      real particles only exist in theory, most particle analysis is actually applied to extended
      bodies with concurrent forces acting on them.</p>

    <title>Equilibrium of a Particle</title>
    <introduction>
      <title>Equilibrium Analysis for Concurrent Force Systems</title>
      <p>If a body is in static equilibrium, then by definition that body is not accelerating. If we
        know that the body is not accelerating then we know that <em> the sum of the forces acting
          on that body must be equal to zero </em> . This is the basis for equilibrium analysis for
        a particle.</p>
      <p>We must also remember that forces are vectors, they have both a magnitude and a direction.
        In order to add together the vectors we will use the vector components in the x, y and
        sometimes z directions. To ensure that the sum of the vectors is truly equal to zero, the
        sum of the magnitudes of the components in any one direction must be equal to zero. To solve
        the equilibrium equations we will break the single vector equation (sum of forces is equal
        to zero) down into two scalar equations for 2D problems (sum of the x components of the
        force vectors is equal to zero, and sum of the y components of the force vectors is equal to
        zero) or down into three scalar equations for 3D problems (sum of the x components of the
        force vectors is equal to zero, sum of the y components of the force vectors is equal to
        zero, and sum of the z components of the force vectors is equal to zero).</p>
      <figure>
        <title>2D Equilibrium Equations</title>
        <caption>In two dimensional problems, the sum of forces in the x direction and the sum of
          forces in the y direction must be equal to zero</caption>

        <title>3D Equilibrium Equations</title>
        <caption>In three dimensional problems, the sum of forces in the x direction, the sum of
          forces in the y direction, and the sum of forces in the z direction must be equal to
          zero.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/3Dequations.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Once we have written out the equilibrium equations, we can solve the equations for any
        unknown forces.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Finding the Equilibrium Equations:</title>
      <p>The first step in finding the equilibrium equations is to draw a free body diagram of the
        body being analyzed. This diagram should show all the force vectors acting on the body. In
        the free body diagram, provide values for any of the know magnitudes or directions for the
        force vectors and provide variable names for any unknowns (either magnitudes or
        directions).</p>
      <figure>
        <title>A free body diagram</title>
        <caption>The first step in equilibrium analysis is drawing a free body diagram. This is done
          by removing everything but the body and drawing in all forces acting on the body. It is
          also useful to label all forces, key dimensions, and angles.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/freebodydiagram.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Next you will need to chose the x, y, and z axes. These axes do need to be perpendicular to
        one another, but they do not necessarily have to be horizontal or vertical. If you choose
        coordinate axes that line up with some of your force vectors you will simplify later
        analysis.</p>
      <p>Once you have chosen axes, you need to break down all of the force vectors into components
        along the x, y and z directions (see the vector decomposition page for more details on this
        process). Your first equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the x
        direction being equal to zero, the second equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the
        components in the y direction being equal to zero, and the third (if you have a 3D problem)
        will be the sum of the magnitudes in the z direction being equal to zero.</p>
      <p>Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can solve these formulas for unknowns. The
        number of unknowns that you will be able to solve for will be the number or equations that
        you have.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Particle vs. Extended Body Analysis:</title>
      <p>For any body in equilibrium, the sum of the forces and the sum of the moments have to be
        equal to zero. For a <em> particle </em> , or for a <em> concurrent force system </em> ,
        there will be <em> no moments acting on the body </em> though. For this reason the moment
        equation or equations will not be helpful for particles (the equation would end up being
        zero is equal to zero). Therefore in particle analysis will rely solely on the sum of the
        forces being equal to zero. When we start analyzing extended bodies with non-concurrent
        forces we will begin to encounter moments, and we will need to ensure the the sum of the
        moments as well as the sum of the forces are also equal to zero.</p>
