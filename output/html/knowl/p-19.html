<p>The defining characteristic of a <dfn class="terminology">particle</dfn> is that all forces that affect it are <dfn class="terminology">coincident</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">concurrent</dfn>, not that it is small. The moon, earth and sun can all be treated as particles, but we probably won't encounter them in statics since they're not in equilibrium. Forces are coincident/concurrent if their lines of action all intersect at a single, common point. Two or more forces are also considered concurrent if they share the same line of action. One practical consequence of this is that particles are never subjected to forces which cause rotation. So a see-saw, for example, is not a particle because the weights of the children tend <a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> to cause rotation.</p>
