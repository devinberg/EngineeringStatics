    <title>Moment About a Point (Scalar Calculations)</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>Given any point on an extended body, if there is a force acting on that body that does not
        travel through that point, then that force will cause a moment about that point. As
        discussed on the moments page, a moment is a force's tendency to cause rotation.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>The Scalar Method in 2 Dimensions</title>
      <p>In discussing how to calculate the moment of a force about a point via scalar quantities,
        we will begin with the example of a force on a simple lever as shown below. In this simple
        lever there is a force on the end of the lever, distance <m>d</m> away from the center of
        rotation for the lever (point <m>A</m>) where the force has a magnitude <m>F</m>. </p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moment About a Point</title>
        <caption>The magnitude of the moment that force <m>F</m> exerts about point <m>A</m> in this
          lever will be equal to the magnitude of the force times distance <m>d</m>.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/lever1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>When using scalar quantities, the magnitude of the moment will be equal to the
        perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force and the point we are taking
        the moment about. </p>
      <p>
        <men>M = F \cdot d_\perp</men>
      </p>
      <p>To determine the sign of the moment, we determine what type of rotation the force would
        cause. In this case we can see that the force would cause the lever to rotate
        counterclockwise about point <m>A</m>. Counterclockwise rotations are caused by positive
        moments while clockwise rotations are caused by negative moments.</p>
      <p>Another important factor to remember is that the value <m>d</m> is the perpendicular
        distance from the force to the point we are taking the moment about. We could measure the
        distance from point <m>A</m> to the head of the force vector, or the tail of the force
        vector, or really any point along the line of action of force <m>F</m>. The distance we need
        to use for the scalar moment calculation however is the shortest distance between the point
        and the line of action of the force. This will always be a line perpendicular to the line of
        action of the force, going to the point we are taking the moment about.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moment About a Point</title>
        <caption>Distance <m>d</m> always needs to be the shortest length between the line of action
          of the force and the point we are taking the moment about. This distance will be
          perpendicular to the line of action of the force.</caption>

    <subsection>
      <title>The Scalar Method in 3 Dimensions</title>
      <p>For three dimensional scalar calculations, we will still find the magnitude of the moment
        in the same way, multiplying the magnitude of the force by the perpendicular distance
        between the point and the line of action of the force. This perpendicular distance again is
        the minimum distance between the point and the line of action of the force. In some cases,
        finding this distance may be difficult.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moments in 3 dimensions</title>
        <caption>For moments in three dimensions, the moment vector will always be perpendicular to
          both the force vector <m>\mathbf{F}</m> and the distance vector
          <m>\mathbf{d}</m>.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/moment3d.png"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <title>The Right Hand Rule</title>
        <caption>To use the right hand rule, align your right hand as shown so that your thumb lines
          up with the axis of rotation for the moment and your curled fingers point in the direction
          of rotation for your moment. If you do this, your thumb will be pointing in the direction
          of the moment vector.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/rhr.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Another difficult factor in three dimensional scalar problems is finding the axis of
        rotation, as this is now more complex that just 'clockwise or counterclockwise'. The axis of
        rotation will be a line traveling though the point we are taking the moment about that is
        perpendicular to both the force force vector and the perpendicular distance vector. Finding
        this direction may be quite difficult for more complex problems where the force and/or
        distance vectors don't line up with a single coordinate direction.</p>
      <p>To further find the direction of the moment vector (which way along the established line)
        we will use the right hand rule. Wrap the fingers of your right hand around the established
        line with your fingertips curling in the direction the body would rotate. If you do this,
        your thumb should point out along the line in the direction of the moment vector.</p>

  <section xml:id="varignons_theorem">
    <title>Varignon's Theorem</title>
    <p>Varignon's Theorem, also often called the principle of moments, states that if we have two or
      more <em>concurrent forces</em>, the sum of the moments that each force creates about a single
      point will be equal to the moment created by the sum of those forces about the same point.</p>
    <figure>
      <title>Varignon's Theroem</title>
      <caption>If the sum of F1 and F2 is Ftotal, then we can assume that the sum of the moments
        about point A exerted by F1 and F2 will be equal to the moment exerted about point A by
        Ftotal</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/varignonstheorem.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>In practice this allows us to do two things when examining moments:</p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, if we are interested in finding the overall moment on a body and we have some
          forces that are concurrent acting on that body, then we can sum those concurrent forces
          before we take the moments about a point or an axis. This may serve to simplify the
          problem in some cases.</li>
        <li>Second, if we are interested in finding the moment that a single force exerts about a
          point or axis, we can break this force down into components and find the moment exerted by
          each component of the force vector. The sum of these moments will be equal to the moment
          exerted by the original force. This will often simplify the problem of finding the
          perpendicular distances for scalar moment calculations.</li>
      </ol>

  <section xml:id="couples">
    <title>Couples</title>
    <p>A <em>couple</em> is a set of equal and opposite forces that exerts a net moment on an object
      but no net force. Because the couple exerts a net moment without exerting a net force, couples
      are also sometimes called <em>pure moments</em>.</p>
    <figure>

      <caption>The two equal and opposite forces exerted on this lug wrench are a couple. They exert
        a moment on the lug nut on this wheel without exerting any net force on the wheel. </caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/lugwrench.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The moment exerted by a couple also differs from the moment exerted by a single force in that
      it is independent of the location you are taking the moment about. In the example below we
      have a couple acting on a beam. Each force has a magnitude F and the distance between the two
      forces is d.</p>
    <figure>
      <title>A couple acting on a beam</title>
      <caption>The moment exerted by this couple is independent of the of the distance x.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/couple.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>Now we have some point A, which is distance x from the first of the two forces. If we take
      the moment of each force about point A, and then add these moments together for the net moment
      about point A we are left with the following formula.</p>
    <figure>
      <title>The moments about point A</title>
      <caption/>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/momentequation2.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>If we rearrange and simplify the formula above, we can see that the variable x actually
      disappears from the equation, leaving the net moment equal to the magnitude of the forces (F)
      times the distance between the two forces (d). </p>
    <figure>
      <title>The moment of a couple</title>
      <caption/>
      <image width="50%" source="images/moore/coupleequation.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>This means that no matter what value of x we have, the magnitude of the moment exerted by the
      couple will be the same. The magnitude of the moment due to the couple is independent of the
      location we are taking the moment about. This will also work in two or three dimensions as
      well. The magnitude of the moment due to a couple will always be equal to the magnitude of the
      forces times the perpendicular distance between the two forces.</p>

    <title>Moment About a Point (Vector Calculations)</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>Given any point on an extended body, if there is a force acting on that body that does not
        travel through that point, then that force will cause a moment about that point. As
        discussed on the moments page, a moment is a force's tendency to cause rotation.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>The Vector Method in 2 and 3 Dimensions</title>
      <p>An alternative to calculating the moment via scalar quantities is to use the <em>vector
          method</em> or <em>cross product method</em>. For simple two dimensional problems, using
        scalar quantities is usually easier, but for more complex problems, using the cross product
        method is usually easier. The cross product method for calculating moments says that the
        moment vector of a force about a point will be equal to the cross product of a vector
          <m>\mathbf{r}</m> from the point to anywhere on the line of action of the force and the
        force vector itself. </p>
      <p>
        <men>\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}</men>
      </p>
      <p>A big advantage of this method is that r does not have to be the shortest distance between
        the point and the line of action, it goes from the point to any part of the line of action.
        For any problem, there are many possible <m>\mathbf{r}</m> vectors, though because of the
        way the cross product works, they should all result in the same moment vector in the
        end.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moment About a Point via the Cross Product</title>
        <caption>The moment vector of the force F about point A will be equal to the cross products
          of the r vector and the force vector. The r vector is a vector from point A to any point
          along the line of action of the force.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/lever3.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It is important to note here that all quantities (<m>\mathbf{r}</m>, <m>\mathbf{F}</m> and
          <m>\mathbf{M}</m>) are vectors. Before you can solve for the cross product, you will need
        to write out <m>\mathbf{r}</m> and <m>\mathbf{F}</m> in vector component form. Also, even
        for two dimensional problems, you will need to write out all three components of the
          <m>\mathbf{r}</m> and <m>\mathbf{F}</m> vectors. For two dimensional problems the <m>z</m>
        components of the <m>\mathbf{r}</m> and <m>\mathbf{F}</m> vectors will simply be zero, but
        those values are necessary for the calculations.</p>
      <p>The moment vector you get will line up with the axis of rotation for the moment, where you
        can use the right hand rule to determine if the moment is going clockwise or
        counterclockwise about that axis.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moment of a Force About a Point via the Cross Product</title>
        <caption>The result of <m>\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}</m> will give us the moment vector.
          For this two dimensional problem, the moment vector is pointing in the positive <m>z</m>
          direction. We can use the right hand rule to determine the direction of rotation from the
          moment (line our right thumb up with the moment vector and our curled fingers will point
          in the direction of rotation from the moment).</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/lever4.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, it is also important to note that cross product, unlike multiplication, is not
        communicative. This means that the order of the vectors matters, and <m>\mathbf{r} \times
          \mathbf{F}</m> is <em>not</em> the same as <m>\mathbf{F} \times \mathbf{r}</m>. It is
        important to always use <m>\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}</m> when calculating moments.</p>

        <title>A Hinge</title>
        <caption>A hinge such as the one shown above will only allow for rotation along the axis of
          the hinge. Since this corresponds to moments along the axis of the hinge, it may be useful
          to specifically calculate the moment a force exerts about the axis of the hinge.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/hinge.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It is sometimes useful to be able to calculate the moment a force exerts about a certain
        set axis that is relevant to the problem. An example would be a force on the door with
        hinges such as the one to the right. If we took the moment about a point (say one of the
        hinges on the door) we may find that the moment vector does not line up with the axis of
        this hinge. In that case, the component of the moment vector that lines up with the axis of
        the hinge will cause a rotation, while the component of the moment vector that does not line
        up with the axis of the hinge will cause reaction moments in the hinge. If we are only
        interested in the rotation of the door, we will want to find the moment that the force
        exerts specifically about the axis of the hinges.</p>

    <subsection>
      <title>Calculating the Moment About an Axis via the Dot Product:</title>
      <p>To find the moment of a force a about a specific axis, we find the moment that the force
        exerts about some point on that axis and then we find the component of the moment vector
        that lines up with the axis we are interested in.</p>
      <p>To do this mathematically, we use the cross product to calculate the moment of the force
        about any point along the axis, and then we take the dot product of a unit vector along the
        axis and the moment vector we just calculated.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>Moment of a Force About an Axis</title>
        <caption>The moment of a force about an axis is the dot product of vector <m>\mathbf{u}</m>
          and the cross product of <m>\mathbf{r}</m> and <m>\mathbf{F}</m>

      <p>The unit vector <m>\mathbf{u}</m> has a magnitude of one and will be pointing in the
        direction of the axis we are interested in. Your final answer from this operation will be a
        scalar value (having a magnitude but no direction). This is the magnitude of the moment
        about the given axis, with the direction being specified by the unit vector
          <m>\mathbf{u}</m>.</p>

    <title>Equilibrium Equations for an Extended Body</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>For an extended body in static equilibrium, the sum or both the <em>forces</em> and the
          <em>moments</em> acting on the body must be equal to zero. The addition of moments (as
        opposed to particles where we only looked at the forces) adds another set of possible
        equilibrium equations, allowing us to solve for more unknowns.</p>
      <p>Moments, like forces, are vectors. This means that our vector equation needs to be broken
        down into scalar components before we solve can solve the equilibrium equations. In a two
        dimensional problem, the body can only have clockwise or counter clockwise rotation
        (corresponding to rotations about the z axis). This means that an extended body in a two
        dimensional problem has three possible equilibrium equations. The sum or force components in
        the x and y directions, and the moments about the z axis. The sum of each of these will be
        equal to zero.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>2D Equilibrium Equations</title>
        <caption>In a two dimensional problem there are three possible equilibrium
          equations.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/2Dequations2.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If we look at a three dimensional problem we will increase the number of possible
        equilibrium equations to six. There are three equilibrium equations for force, where the sum
        of the components in the x, y, and z direction must be equal to zero. The body may also have
        moments about each of the three axes. The second set of three equilibrium equations states
        that the sum of the moment components about the x, y, and z axes must also be equal to
        zero.</p>
      <figure>
        <title>3D Equilibrium Equations</title>
        <caption>In a three dimensional problem there are six possible equilibrium
          equations.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/moore/3Dequations2.png"/>
      </figure>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Finding the Equilibrium Equations:</title>
      <p>The first step in finding the equilibrium equations is to draw a free body diagram of the
        body being analyzed. This diagram should show all the force vectors acting on the body. In
        the free body diagram, provide values for any of the know magnitudes, directions, and points
        of application for the force vectors and provide variable names for any unknowns (either
        magnitudes, directions, or distances).</p>
      <p>Next you will need to chose the x, y, and z axes. These axes do need to be perpendicular to
        one another, but they do not necessarily have to be horizontal or vertical. If you choose
        coordinate axes that line up with some of your force vectors you will simplify later
        analysis.</p>
      <p>Once you have chosen axes, you need to break down all of the force vectors into components
        along the x, y and z directions (see the vector decomposition page for more details on this
        process). Your first equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the x
        direction being equal to zero, the second equation will be the sum of the magnitudes of the
        components in the y direction being equal to zero, and the third (if you have a 3D problem)
        will be the sum of the magnitudes in the z direction being equal to zero.</p>
      <p>Next you will need to come up with the the moment equations. To do this you will need to
        choose a point to take the moments about. Any point should work, but it is usually
        advantageous to choose a point that will decrease the number of unknowns in the equation.
        Remember that any force vector that travels through a given point will exert no moment about
        that point. To write out the moment equations simply sum the moments exerted by each force
        (adding in pure moments shown in the diagram) about the given point and the given axis (x,
        y, or z) and set that sum equal to zero. All moments will be about the z axis for two
        dimensional problems, though moments can be about x, y and z axes for three dimensional
        problems.</p>
      <p>Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can solve these formulas for unknowns. The
        number of unknowns that you will be able to solve for will be the number or equations that
        you have.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Particle vs. Extended Body Analysis:</title>
      <p>For any body to be in equilibrium, the sum of the forces and the sum of the moments have to
        be equal to zero. For a an <em>extended body</em> with <em>non-concurrent forces</em> acting
        on it. we can take advantage of both the force and moment equations, giving us up to three
        possible equilibrium equations for two dimensional problems and six possible equilibrium
        equations for three dimensional problems.</p>
