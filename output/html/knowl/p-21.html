<p>Another simplification we will be making is to treat all forces as <dfn class="terminology">concentrated forces</dfn>. Concentrated forces act at a single point, have a well defined line of action, and can be represented with an arrow â€” in other words, they are vectors. Real forces don't actually act at a single mathematical point, but concentrating them is intuative and will be justified in a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: distributed loads]</code>. You're already familiar with the concept if you have ever placed all the weight of an object at its center of gravity.</p>
