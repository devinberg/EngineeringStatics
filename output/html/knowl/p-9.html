<p>A <dfn class="terminology">rigid body</dfn> is a body which doesn't deform under load, that is to say, an object which doesn't bend, stretch, or twist when forces are applied to it.  It is an idealization or approximation because no objects in the real world behave this way; however, this simplification still produces valuable information.  You will drop the rigid body assumption and study deformation, stress, and strain in a later course called <span class="booktitle">Strength of Materials</span> or <span class="booktitle">Mechanics of Materials</span>. In that course you will perform analysis of non-rigid bodies, but each problem you do <em class="emphasis">there</em> will begin with the rigid body analysis you will learn to do <em class="emphasis">here</em>.</p>
