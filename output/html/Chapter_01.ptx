<p>Engineering Statics (hereafter shortened to Statics) is the gateway course into the rest of engineering mechanics, which is the application of mechanics to solve problems involving common engineering elements.</p>
<p>The name <term>Statics</term> refers to the fact that the main focus of this course is solving problems related to particles or rigid bodies that are in equilibrium (and hence are not moving or static). Beyond this introductory chapter, this book will move into the basic principles and mathematical operations of force and position vectors (Ch 2). Then you will have an opportunity to practice these vector principles on particle equilibrium problems (Ch 3). Next, we’ll focus on the rotational tendency of forces, called moments (which is the same as torque in Ch 4). In Chapter 5, we’ll introduce the concept of balance of forces and moments, known as equilibrium. Then in Chapter 6, you will be expanding your knowledge of equilibrium to include various multi-body trusses, frames, and machines. In Chapter 7, we will divert from equilibrium to focus on finding the center of mass and area moment of inertia for shapes. Chapter 8 is the only part of Statics which looks at the internal (vs. external) forces and moments. Chapter 9 expands equilibrium to include various types of friction forces. Finally, Chapter 10 demonstrates an alternate equilibrium methodology called virtual work. Your Statics course may not cover all of these topics, or choose to move through them in a different order.</p>
<p>The knowledge gained in Statics will then flow into other engineering mechanics topics of Dynamics, Mechanics of Solids (also commonly called Mechanics of Materials), and Fluids. For many of you, Statics will be one of the most foundational engineering courses of your academic career. </p>
<p>We will build upon your knowledge gained in the prerequisite courses of Physics I and Calculus I. Later in this chapter, you can find the specifics of the topics/skills we will expect that you have brought with you into Statics from these prerequisite courses and your life experience.</p>

<title>Newton’s Laws of Motion</title>

<introduction>
<p>Before jumping into Sir Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion, let us quickly talk about motion itself. Motion can be separated into two types:</p>
<p><ul><li><term>translation</term>: when a body changes position without rotating and </li><li><term>rotation</term>: the spinning of a body about an axis.</li></ul></p>
<p>Some moving bodies are purely translating or rotating, many are doing both. Conveniently, we can often isolate the translation and rotation of a body into separate equations as you will see related to Newton’s 2nd Law below.</p></introduction><subsection xml:id="newtons-first-law">

<title>Newton's 1st Law</title>


<p>Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.</p><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-first-law-application-to-translational-motion">

<title>Application to Translational Motion</title>


<p>This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia", means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. In other words, if an object is at rest it will remain at rest until the resultant force (or net sum of forces) is out of equilibrium and changes the velocity, and if an object is moving at a constant velocity (which includes both speed and direction), it will remain at that same velocity until a force begins to change the velocity.</p>

<p>Figure XX: This rock is at rest with zero velocity and will remain at rest until a net force causes the rock to move. The net force on the rock is the sum of any force pushing the rock and the friction force of the ground on the rock opposing that force.

<title>Application to Rotational Motion</title>


<p>Newton's first law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. A moment (or torque) is the rotational tendency of a force and you will learn much more about moments in Ch 4. A body will maintain its current rotational velocity until a moment is exerted to change that rotational velocity. This can be seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that will continue spinning once started until friction, brakes or a moment either speeds up or slows down the spinning motion.</p>
<p/>
<p>Figure XX: In the absence of friction, this spinning top would continue to spin forever, but the small frictional moment exerted at the point of contact between the top and the ground will slow the tops spinning over time.

<title>Newton's 2nd Law</title>


<p>Newton's second law states that a particle accelerates in the direction of and at a rate proportional to the net applied force.</p><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-translational-motion">

<title>Application to Translational Motion</title>


<p>For translational motion, Newton’s 2nd law can be depicted by the equation </p>
<p><md><mrow>\Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a}</mrow></md></p>
<p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration in the equation above have an arrow above them. This means that they are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a <em>scalar</em> quantity, which has only a magnitude. Both the definition and equation reflect that the magnitude of the net force is proportional to the acceleration of an object and the direction of the net force also dictates the acceleration direction of the object.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs xml:id="newtons-second-law-application-to-rotational-motion">

<title>Application to Rotational Motion</title>


<p>Newton's second law states that the sum of moments on an object will be proportional to angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha} </m>of the object. The proportionality constant is what is known as the mass moment of inertia of the object (I). In equation form this is:</p>
<p><md><mrow>\Sigma\vec{M}=I\vec{\alpha}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Notice that the moment and the angular acceleration are vector quantities (given the arrow notation) and thus have both a magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude. Vectors and scalars will be covered in more detail in <xref ref="Chapter_02"/>.</p></paragraphs></subsection><subsection xml:id="newtons-third-law">

<title>Newton's 3rd Law</title>


<p>Newton's Third Law states "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." </p>
<p>The primary action Newton is referring to are forces, so for every force one body exerts on another body, the second body exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on the first body. Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all forces come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting.</p>
<p/>
<p>Figure XX: The gravitational pull of the earth and moon represent interacting bodies where the earth exerts a gravitational force on the moon, and the moon exerts an equal and opposite force on the earth.</p>
<p>Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single body, it is important to remember that for interacting bodies, each of the forces acts on a separate body. This can sometimes be confusing when there are multiple interacting bodies. The trick for these multi-body systems (as discussed in the creation of Free Body Diagrams in Ch 3 and Ch 5, is to isolate the body or system which exposes the forces you wish to solve for.</p>
<p>[add figure of your physics book sitting on a table (or a box?), draw FBD of book + table and separate FBD of book alone]</p>
<p>Figure XX: We use FBD’s to expose the forces we want to solve for in a problem. If you wanted to solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we would use FBD (a) as it includes those forces. Notice that FBD (a) does not include the interaction forces between the book and table. However, when the book is isolated in FBD (b) and (c) we can see that the equal and opposite interaction forces between the book and table are exposed.</p></subsection></section><section xml:id="Chapter_01-unit-systems">

<title>Unit Systems</title>


<p>The magnitude of a vector needs to also have units associated with it. You will recall from Physics that there are two primary unit systems. The International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French <foreign>Système international (d'unités)</foreign> is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units, which are the second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela. We will only use units a second, meter, and kilogram in Statics. The prefixes to the unit names specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit. </p>
<p>The United States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The United States customary system developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The standard units for time, distance, and mass in Statics are a second, foot, and slug. Note that this text does not use pounds mass, instead opting to use slugs for all US customary units masses and avoiding the pounds mass vs. pounds-force confusion. </p>
<p>The magnitude of force <m>F</m> is measured in units of mass [m] times length [L] divided by time [t] squared [<m>F=\text{m L}/\text{t}^2</m>]. In metric units, the most common force unit is the newton [N] where one newton is a kilogram multiplied by a meter per second squared. This means that a one-newton force would cause a one-kilogram object to accelerate at a rate of one-meter-per-second-squared, or in more familiar terms, a newton weighs about a quarter pound. In English units, the most common unit is the pound-force [<m>\text{lb}_\text{f}</m>] (or pound [lb] for short when there's no confusion with a pound-mass [<m>\text{lb_m}</m>].) where one pound is equal to one slug times a foot over a second squared. This means that a one pound-force would cause an object with a mass of one slug to accelerate at a rate of one foot per second squared. It is worth noting that many physics texts use pounds mass [<m>\text{lb_m}</m>] exclusively instead of slugs (where 32.174 lbm = 1 slug). This text will use slugs as they are the standard mass unit in U. S. customary system and they have a parallel use to kilograms in the SI system. </p>
<p>Thus looking at the units of forces across the unit systems we can show:</p>
<p>General definition: <m>\text{force} = \dfrac{[\text{mass}] \cdot [\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}^2\}</m></p>
<p>SI Units: <m>\text{1 Newton}=\dfrac{[\text{kg}][\text{m}]}{\[text{s}^2]}</m></p>
<p>US Customary Units: <m>\text{1 pound [lb]}=\dfrac{[\text{slug}]\cdot[\text{ft}]}{[\text{s}^2]}</m></p>
<p>Note that when you are relating the weight to the mass of an object, that you are actually applying Newton’s Second Law (<m>\Sigma\vec{F}=m\vec{a}</m>) as seen in <xref ref="units_table"/> below.</p><table xml:id="units_table">
