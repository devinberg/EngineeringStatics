<div class="introduction">
<p>You are undoubtedly familiar with utility poles which carry electric, cable and telephone lines, but have you ever noticed as you drive down a winding road that the poles will switch from one side of the road to the other and back again?  Why is this?</p>
<p>If you consider the forces acting on the top of a pole beside a curving section of road you'll observe that the tensions of the cables produce a net force towards the road.  This force is typically opposed by a “guy wire” pulling in the opposite direction which prevents the pole from moving (tipping over) due to unbalanced forces.  The power company tries to keep poles beside road segments with convex curvature. If they didn't switch sides, the guy wire for poles at concave curves would extend into the road... which is a poor design.</p>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h6>
<p>Consider the utility pole next to the road shown below.  If each of the six cables pulls with a force of \(10.0~\text{ kN} \text{,}\) determine the magnitude of the tension in the guy wire.</p>

<span class="type">Solution</span><p><dfn class="terminology">Assumptions</dfn></p>
<p>A utility pole isn't two-dimensional, but we will consider the top view and forces in the horizontal plane only.</p>
<p>It also isn't a concurrent force problem because the lines of action of the forces don't all intersect at a single point.  However,  we can make it into one by replacing the forces of the three cables in each direction with a single force three times larger.  This is an example of an <dfn class="terminology">equivalent transformation</dfn>, a trick engineers use frequently to turn complex situations into  simpler ones.  It works here because all the tensions are equal, and the outside wires are equidistant from the center wire.  You must be careful to to justify all equivalent transformations, because they will lead to errors if they are not applied correctly.  Equivalent transformations will be discussed in greater detail in  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: equivalent tranformation]</code> later.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Givens</dfn></p>
<p>\(T\) = 10.0~\text{ kN}</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Procedure</dfn></p>
<p>Begin by drawing a neat, labeled, free body diagram of the pole, establishing a coordinate system and indicating the directions of the forces.  Although it is not necessary, it simplifies this problem considerably to note the symmetry and establish the \(x\)-axis along the axis of symmetry.  Let \(T\) be the tension in one wire, and \(G\) be the tension of the guy wire.</p>
