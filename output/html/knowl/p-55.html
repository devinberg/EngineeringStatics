<p>So for example, \(F_x = 10\) N is a scalar component. We can tell it's not a vector because it \(F_x\) is not bold. 10 N is the magnitude of the associated vector; the subscript \(x\) indicates that the force acts "in the \(x\) direction," in other words it acts on a line of action which is parallel to the \(x\)-axis; and the (implied) positive sign means that the vector points towards the positive end of the \(x\)- axis â€” towards positive infinity.  So a scalar component, while not a vector, contains all the information necessary to draw the corresponding vector.  Be careful not to confuse scalar components with vector magnitudes.  A force with a magnitude of 10 N can point in any direction, but can never have a negative magnitude.</p>
